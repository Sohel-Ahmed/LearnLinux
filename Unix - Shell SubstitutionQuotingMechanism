Unix - Shell Substitution
----------------------------------
What is Substitution?

The shell performs substitution when it encounters an expression that contains one or more special characters.

Example
Here, the printing value of the variable is substituted by its value. Same time, "\n" is substituted by a new line −

#!/bin/sh

a=10
echo -e "Value of a is $a \n"
You will receive the following result. Here the -e option enables the interpretation of backslash escapes.

Value of a is 10
Following is the result without -e option −

Value of a is 10\nExample
